Thank you for purchasing Medieval Brewery & Vineyard.

This pack is base on LOW poly modeling typically used in large world or MMO type games that need optimized modeling. Most Textures are 512x512 and tile-able for easy texture changes. Normal Maps are included with textures. I did not create every possible prefab combination as they are nearly limitless. I did however create several for each type in each group to get you started.

This pack contains, in total ..., 

63 Game Objects (Prefabs & Models Combined)
74 Textures (most 512x512 tiled)
43 Materials
